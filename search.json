    "text": "In just the past 10 years the New York Jets have become an average to below average football organization in the NFL with 1 Super Bowl win happening in 1969. Time has not been kind to the 2nd team from East Rutherford currently holding the longest playoff drought in the NFL right now at 11 seasons but could change soon enough with the young talent in New York. With many memories like the Butt Fumble of Mark Sanchez to Geno Smith getting his jaw broken by his own teammate or the many quarterbacks one day hoping to take them back to the days of Broadway Joe Namath or at least above .500. Today we will look to see if the Jets are not only a bottom tier team but if there is enough to show that they are the worst team since 2010.\nBelow we will start with comparing Offensive and Defensive EPA (expected points added) which is a measure of how well a team performs relative to expectation. You can use EPA in many aspects but is most commonly used to measure many aspects of team success and predict how matchups between teams will play out. On offense you would like a high EPA because you are trying to score while defense you would like a low EPA.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.3.6      ✔ purrr   0.3.4 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.4.1 \n✔ readr   2.1.2      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(nflreadr)\nlibrary(nflplotR)\n\npbp <- load_pbp(2010:2021) %>%\n  filter(season_type == \"REG\") %>% #finding only for regular season games so no team stats are skewed due to playoff appearances\n  filter(!is.na(posteam) & (rush == 1 | pass == 1))\noffense <- pbp %>%\n  group_by(team = posteam) %>%\n  summarise(off_epa = mean(epa, na.rm = TRUE))\ndefense <- pbp %>%\n  group_by(team = defteam) %>%\n  summarise(def_epa = mean(epa, na.rm = TRUE))\noffense %>%\n inner_join(defense, by = \"team\") %>% #inner join merges the data frames\n  ggplot(aes(x = off_epa, y = def_epa)) + #creating the chart using ggplot and adding x and y axis \n  geom_mean_lines(aes(h_var = off_epa, v_var = def_epa)) +\n  geom_nfl_logos(aes(team_abbr = team), width = 0.07, alpha = 0.7) + #adding nfl team logos instead of dots\n  labs(\n    x = \"Offense EPA/play\",\n    y = \"Defense EPA/play\",\n    caption = \"Data: nflfastR | By: Jack Coil\",\n    title = \"2010-2021 NFL Offensive and Defensive EPA per Play\",\n    subtitle = \"The Jets rank among the worst in offensive EPA and just below the league average in defensive EPA\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8, hjust = 0.5)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_reverse()\n\n\n\n\n\nExample from “the33rdteam.com”, Say the Chiefs start with the ball first-and-10 from their own 25-yard line, where its expected points would be about 1.06. If Patrick Mahomes throws a 15-yard completion, making it first-and-10 on the KC 40-yard line, where the expected points is now 1.88, the EPA of that play would be 1.88 – 1.06 or 0.82. In other words, that completion increased the Chiefs’ expected points on that drive by just over three-fourths of a point."
