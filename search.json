    "text": "Below we will start with comparing Offensive and Defensive EPA (expected points added) which is a measure of how well a team performs relative to expectation. You can use EPA in many aspects but is most commonly used to measure many aspects of team success and predict how match ups between teams will play out. On offense you would like a high EPA because you are trying to score while defense you would like a low EPA.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(nflreadr)\nlibrary(nflplotR)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\npbp <- load_pbp(2010:2021) %>%\n  filter(season_type == \"REG\") %>% #finding only for regular season games so no team stats are skewed due to playoff appearances\n  filter(!is.na(posteam) & (rush == 1 | pass == 1))\noffense <- pbp %>%\n  group_by(team = posteam) %>%\n  summarise(off_epa = mean(epa, na.rm = TRUE))\ndefense <- pbp %>%\n  group_by(team = defteam) %>%\n  summarise(def_epa = mean(epa, na.rm = TRUE))\noffense %>%\n inner_join(defense, by = \"team\") %>% #inner join merges the data frames\n  ggplot(aes(x = off_epa, y = def_epa)) + #creating the chart using ggplot and adding x and y axis \n  geom_mean_lines(aes(h_var = off_epa, v_var = def_epa)) +\n  geom_nfl_logos(aes(team_abbr = team), width = 0.07, alpha = 0.7) + #adding nfl team logos instead of dots\n  labs(\n    x = \"Offense EPA/play\",\n    y = \"Defense EPA/play\",\n    caption = \"Data: nflfastR | By: Jack Coil\",\n    title = \"2010-2021 NFL Offensive and Defensive EPA per Play\",\n    subtitle = \"The Jets rank among the worst in offensive EPA and just below the league average in defensive EPA\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8, hjust = 0.5)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_reverse()\n\n\n\n\n\nExample from “the33rdteam.com”, Say the Chiefs start with the ball first-and-10 from their own 25-yard line, where its expected points would be about 1.06. If Patrick Mahomes throws a 15-yard completion, making it first-and-10 on the KC 40-yard line, where the expected points is now 1.88, the EPA of that play would be 1.88 – 1.06 or 0.82. In other words, that completion increased the Chiefs’ expected points on that drive by just over three-fourths of a point.\n\n\nCode\ndata21 <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350/blog/posts/are-the-jets-the-worst/jets/2021.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2021) \ndata20 <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350/blog/posts/are-the-jets-the-worst/jets/2020.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2020) \ndata19 <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350/blog/posts/are-the-jets-the-worst/jets/2019.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2019) \ndata18 <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350/blog/posts/are-the-jets-the-worst/jets/2018.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2018) \ndata17 <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350/blog/posts/are-the-jets-the-worst/jets/2017.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2017)\ndata16 <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350/blog/posts/are-the-jets-the-worst/jets/2016.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2016) \ndata15 <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350/blog/posts/are-the-jets-the-worst/jets/2015.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2015) \ndata14 <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350/blog/posts/are-the-jets-the-worst/jets/2014.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2014) \ndata13 <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350/blog/posts/are-the-jets-the-worst/jets/2013.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2013)\ndata12 <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350/blog/posts/are-the-jets-the-worst/jets/2012.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2012)\ndata11 <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350/blog/posts/are-the-jets-the-worst/jets/2011.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2011) \ndata10 <- read_csv(\"~/Documents/SPMC 350/blog/posts/are-the-jets-the-worst/jets/2010.csv\") %>% mutate(Season = 2010) \n\ncombined <- bind_rows(data10, data11, data12, data13, data14, data15, data16, data17, data18, data19, data20, data21) %>% mutate(Tm = gsub(\"\\\\*\", \"\", Tm)) %>% mutate(Tm = gsub(\"\\\\+\", \"\", Tm)) \n\nwinpct <- combined %>%\n  group_by(Tm) %>%\n  summarise(\n    winpct = mean(`W-L%`),\n    Season = n()\n  ) %>%\n  filter(winpct < .45)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=winpct, aes(x=reorder(Tm, winpct), weight=winpct, fill=winpct)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  geom_text(aes(x=3, y=.3, label=\"\"), color=\"green\") %>%\nlabs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"Team Win Percentage\",\n    caption = \"Data: Pro Football Reference | By: Jack Coil\",\n    title = \"2010-2021 NFL Win Percentages\",\n    subtitle = \"The Jets rank 4th worst in Win Percentage in the last 11 years\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jets, again, rank among the worst in the NFL in Win Percentage but not enough to take over last.\n\n\nCode\nsimple <- combined %>%\n  group_by(Tm) %>%\n  summarise(\n    SRS = mean(SRS),\n    SoS = mean(SoS),\n    Wins = sum(W),\n    Season = n()\n  )\n\njets <- simple %>%\n  filter(Tm == \"New York Jets\")\n\ncrap <- simple %>%\n  filter(SRS < -2.5)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=simple, \n    aes(x=SoS, y=SRS, size= \"\"),\n    color = \"grey\",\n    alpha=.5) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=jets, \n    aes(x=SoS, y=SRS, size=\"\"), \n    color=\"darkgreen\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = -0.1164616) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.04100529) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data = crap, \n    aes(x=SoS, y=SRS, label=Tm)\n  ) +\nlabs(\n    x = \"Strength of Schedule\",\n    y = \"Simple Rating System (SRS)\",\n    caption = \"Data: Pro Football Reference | By: Jack Coil\",\n    title = \"Strength of Schedule vs Simple Rating in the NFL\",\n    subtitle = \"The Jets have above average schedule but rank among the worst in SRS\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 0.5)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nthe Jets fall well below the Simple Rating with only two teams worse but have a stronger schedule than the league average.\nThe New York Jets have historically been bad as shown through the data it shows that they are not the worst team in the league but are consistently in the bottom 5 teams."
